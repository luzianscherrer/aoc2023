# Advent of Code Programming Challenge 2023

It's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) again...

This time I was trying to make use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and the like as much as possible. I also went full on [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html) for the graph related stuff.

The most difficult levels to me were [5b](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5), [12b](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12), [21b](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21), and [24b](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/24). I  needed hints for all of those. 

Other noteworthy encounters:

- Most fun: [8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8) and [13](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13)
- Most boring: [15b](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15)
- Best plot twist for part 2: [8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)
- Easiest: [25](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25)
